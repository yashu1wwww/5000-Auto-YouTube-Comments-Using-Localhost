## 𝙬𝙖𝙩𝙘𝙝 𝙪𝙥𝙩𝙤 3mins.46sec+ 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙧𝙚𝙢𝙖𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜 code in the script

First, open Chrome file location and bypass the location restriction using an extension such as Touch VPN. In my case, the Chrome location(use start in: path) is

C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

click window button and search cmd and enter

cd C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application (1st line in cmd)

in line enter

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=""(in "enter your localhost path here")

Next, enter this command into the terminal, replacing "enter your localhost path here" with your localhost path:

For example, in my case it is:

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Bots\Chromedriver\Localhost" (2nd line in cmd make sure you replace the localhost path)

then again open new terminal in that folder enter
pip install selenium==4.2.0

after enter 5000.py or double click on 5000.py

In lines 11 and 12 of the code, change the comments if you want to use something different.

In line 21, change the movie video URL to the required URL.

That's it! The URL will open in the previously opened localhost Chrome and 5000+ auto comments will be done automatically.

👉Note:-

👉if your selenium version is in latest version then the code never run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"

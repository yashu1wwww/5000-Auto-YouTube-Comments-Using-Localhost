or after chrome opens using localhost

in extension on the other location using these

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/touch-vpn-secure-and-unli/bihmplhobchoageeokmgbdihknkjbknd?hl=en

C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

in my case chrome location(use start in:) is

cd C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

next,

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=""(in "enter your localhost path here")

Next, enter this command into the terminal, replacing "enter your localhost path here" with your localhost path:

For example, in my case it is:

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Bots\Chromedriver\Localhost"

then new terminal in that folder and enter 5000.py

Then, open the command prompt in that folder and paste the following two lines one at a time and press enter. (The code below assumes that you have watched the video and have set up the correct Chrome and localhost path.)

cd C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Bots\Chromedriver\Localhost"

## To do 5000+ auto comments, you must log in with 10+ gmail accounts and each gmail must contain 10 brand accounts


# after login with 10 accs add these extension
https://shorturl.at/mtAER

In lines 11 and 12 of the code, change the comments if you want to use something different.

In line 21, change the movie video URL to the required URL.

That's it! The URL will open in the previously opened localhost Chrome and 5000+ auto comments will be done automatically.
